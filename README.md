# Learning-Algorithms-and-related-files

Source code for algortithms which I implemeted during my three-months internship at the Centre for High Performance Computing in Cambridge.
The files GDA.cpp in the folder classification and OLS.cpp in the folder regression were used as teaching material at their Autumn Academy.
